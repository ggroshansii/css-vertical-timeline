                        Fishman. Anastasio and Fishman had met that October, after Anastasio overheard Fishman playing
                        drums in his dormitory room, and asked if he and Holdsworth could jam with him.[11] Gordon met
                        the trio shortly thereafter, having answered a want-ad for a bass guitarist that Anastasio had
                        posted around the university</p>

                    <p class='description'>Harris Millis Cafeteria at the University of Vermont on December 2, 1983,
                        where
                        they
                        played a set of classic rock covers, including two songs by the Grateful Dead.[13][14] The band
                        performed one more concert in 1983, and then did not perform again for nearly a year, stemming
                        from
                        Anastasio's suspension from the university following a prank he had pulled with a friend.</p>

                        <p class='description'>The quartet eventually named themselves Phish, and they played their
                            first
                            concert under that name on October 23 of that year.[19] Anastasio designed the band's logo,
                            which featured the group's name inside a stylized fish.[20] The band's members have given
                            several different origins for the name Phish.</p>
